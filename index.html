          I’m a first year student at ESSEC BBA 👨‍🎓 in Paris, France 🇫🇷 , and I’m 18 years old. I don’t know what to say about me... just I am who I am. In the foreground I’m a hard worker 📚, shy 🙈, very calm and discreet 🤐 but in the background, I’m THE ill girl 🤪 few have ever seen me without self-control and my good grip, these few people are my very very close friends ❤️
          But I still down to earth 🌍 that’s why I have attached a link below to make you discover a wonderful search engine ! It’s totally free and you can make good deeds 🌱

        <h2>Cars 🚗🏎</h2>
        <p>
          I am passionate by cars, especially supercars, luxury cars but I know a lot about normal cars too. I can’t say that I know all the models and brands of the world, but most of them 🙃!
          My favorite brand in the category of supercars is Bugatti, and it’s important to mention that it's a French brand 🇫🇷🤑

        <h2>Sport 🏋️‍</h2>
        <p>
          I've always loved artistic gymnastics 🤸‍ and dance. However, Netflix and chill parties are much more attractive!

        <h2>Astrology ♍️</h2>
        <p>
          As you could understand my astrological sign is taurus, I let you imagine the person that I am ... I am the person that everyone can count on, the person who has only one vocation in life: to help others, often in spite of one's own interests.

        <h2>Travel ✈️</h2>
        <p>
          I would love to travel. To this day, I have already been to many countries in Europe and in America, but I would love to discover the African continent 🌎

        <h2>Love ❤️</h2>
        <p>
         How can I tell you, it's worse than no man's land, at least a few ventured into it. Concerning me, no one has ever ventured there before ... so if you are interested, come into my dm of my social networks 😉😂
